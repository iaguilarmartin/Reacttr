# Reacttr

A reduced version of Twitter web page built using ReactJS.
The only way of getting access to the application is using your Github account on login.

Once inside the web page users are able to publish new tweets, retweet existing tweets, reply to them or just mark as favorite.

Appliction is supported by a **Firebase** real time database.

The project is available to be visited [here](https://curso-react-25aa9.firebaseapp.com/)
